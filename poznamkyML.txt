similarity learning:
--regession: pairs are given with similarity, we are learning a function that tkes two points and learns the similarity
--mbalaz sim triplet learner (is y more similar to x than x is to z)
-- triplet similairtyt learning(x,y) input is x,y,z f(x,y)>f(x,z) similar to mbalaz triplet learning

metric learning:-> shold have triangle inequality, distance is basically inverse of similarity, low distance means high similarity

triplet loss
  -- many different version L(A,P,N) distance from furthest P and closest N must be at least alpha P-N+alfa, but take max for p and min for N
  -- hard negatives mining

learge margin nearest neighbour
  -- simalr to tripplet loss, penalize for too close Negatives, and minimize min sum dP+  min sum max(0,1-N)


quadruplet d(X,y)<alpha+d(z,w)  blue pair is good red pair is bad

--------Meta learning
- can mean anything 
  for example just learning what parameters of optimizer to use, or what should be initial parameters
  -- multiple iteration of training can be seen as one meta-step, so gradient for trainer can be computed
  -- can learn entire update rule
  -- search for hyperparameters could be seen as meta learning
